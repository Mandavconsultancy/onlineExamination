<p><b>Intro:</b></p>
<p> If you want to use this program on a website you can for free. </a>
  . And don`t forget to rate the script on www.hotscripts.com!</p>
<p><b><a name="1"></a>Requirements:</b></p>
<p>You will need a webserver which has installed PHP 4, and mySQL version 3.2
  upwards.</p>
<p><b><a name="2"></a>Installation:</b></p>
<p>1. Unzip the.php and .css files and place them on your webserver (or locally,
  as you will have to make some changes and then upload) in a directory called
  quiz or whatever. Put the quiz1.php file into an html template or page of your
  site. This is what the public see. The other files (excluding quiz.sql and this
  file which should not be uploaded) are administration, and should be protected
  with some level of user authentication.</p>
<p>2. Open <b>config.php</b> and change the variables to your server specification.</p>
<p>3. You need to create the table quiz in your mySQL database. (You can alter
  the table name, but you need to change the entry in config.php, and the table
  name in quiz.sql.) Either via telnet, or using a program such as <a href="http://www.anse.de/mysqlfront/">mySQLfront</a>,
  or <a href="http://phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net">phpMyAdmin</a> enter the information
  stored in <b>quiz.sql</b>. You can create a separate database for the quiz if
  you like, it`s up to you.</p>
<p>That`s it!</p>
<p>Optional extras:</p>
<p>Password proctection is best done with .htaccess and .htpassword files. There
  are tutorials out there to help.</p>
<p>You can move the config.php file to another directory if you want to make it
  safer - just remember to alter the include( ) statement in dbconnect.php.</p>
